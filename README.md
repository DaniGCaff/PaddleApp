# PaddleApp

PaddleApp is a web oriented app developed during my last university year. It consist of a front and a backend. 
Backend has three REST APIs for users, courts and books management. It is written in PHP and Slim Framework (some kind of Laravel lite distribution)

Frontend is written in javascript, and is supported by AngularJS. AngularJS is a little bit complex, so if you need help, dont hesistate to contact me. I will be glad to help you ;-)
