# PaddleApp

PaddleApp is a web oriented app developed during my last university year. It consist of a front and a backend. 
Backend has three REST APIs for users, courts and books management. It is written in PHP and Slim Framework (some kind of Laravel lite distribution)

Frontend is written in javascript, and is supported by AngularJS. AngularJS is a little bit complex, so if you need help, dont hesistate to contact me. I will be glad to help you ;-)

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

    php composer.phar create-project slim/slim-skeleton [my-app-name]

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
